# Design Choices

This project prioritizes emotional safety and non-intrusive interaction over technical complexity or performance.

## Screen-based Interaction
Instead of motors or locomotion, a screen-based expressive face was chosen to convey presence and emotion. This reduced mechanical complexity while allowing rich, subtle feedback through animations.

## One-directional Care
The robot offers reminders, affirmations, and check-ins without requiring user responses. This avoids creating pressure, obligation, or emotional dependency.

## Physical Restraint
The robot is designed to be desk-sized, quiet by default, and easy to store. A silent mode is included to respect study and rest environments.
