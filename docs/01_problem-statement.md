# Problem Statement

Mental health struggles often worsen when support becomes inconsistent, especially for students under academic pressure. Distance can further limit the ability of close friends to provide meaningful, everyday support.

This project explores whether a small, non-intrusive robotic companion can help reduce this gap by offering gentle reminders, affirmations, and a sense of presence. Without demanding attention or creating dependency.

The goal is not to solve mental health challenges, but to provide subtle support that fits naturally into daily routines.
